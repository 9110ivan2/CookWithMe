## Database Setup

### 4.1 Database Models Overview

CookWithMe uses a relational database to manage users, recipes, ingredients, and categories. Hereâ€™s a summary of the main models:

- **User**: Handles authentication and user profiles.
- **Profile**: Stores additional user information.
- **Category**: Supports hierarchical categories (umbrella and subcategories) for recipes.
- **Recipe**: Represents a recipe, linked to users and categories.
- **Ingredient**: Represents an ingredient.
- **RecipeIngredient**: Associates ingredients with recipes, including quantity and unit.

### 4.2 Making Migrations

To create migrations for the database, run:

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
```

### 4.3 Applying Migrations

Apply the migrations to set up your database schema:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

## Testing with Postman

To test the API, you can use Postman:

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the CookWithMe project, including how to register and log in as a user, and interact with the API endpoints. Adjust any specific URLs or paths according to your actual project setup.
